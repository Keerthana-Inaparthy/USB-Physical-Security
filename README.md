# USB-Physical-Security
USB Physical Security application is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing USB port access, ensuring that sensitive data is protected from 
unauthorized access. The application is built with enhanced security features that gobeyond traditional password protection, incorporating multi-layered security measures 
such as admin and OTP verification. This dual verification process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as it requires both administrative credentials 
and a one-time password sent to the registered email.

Key features include admin verification, requiring administrative credentials for any action, and OTP verification, which sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to the registered email after admin credentials are verified. This two-step verification process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. The application also offers timed access, 
enabling users to specify a duration for USB port activation. This ensures that USB ports are not left enabled indefinitely, reducing security risks. Once the specified 
duration expires, the USB ports are automatically disabled, maintaining continuous protection. 
The application includes a Disable USB Ports Button, which initiates the process to disable all USB ports on the device. Users must verify their admin credentials and 
complete OTP verification to proceed, preventing unauthorized data transfer and potential malware infections. The Enable USB Ports Button allows users to enable 
USB ports temporarily, with admin and OTP verification, and specify a duration for USB port enablement. This feature is useful for controlled access during data transfers 
or peripheral installations.
